CatSh is a compiled language that compiles to a scratch .sb3 file.

# What you'll need:
  * `python`
  * wave python module

# Running:
  * open a shell (`cmd`, `powershell`, `bash`, `zsh`, `sh`, etc..)
  * navigate to the folder where the python compilation script is located
  * run `python main.py compile {path to .catsh file}`
  * import the output.sb3 file into scratch and enjoy!
  * NOTE: there may be some duplicate blocks when importing. that is not done by the script instead is done by scratch. if you know a fix, please let me know.

# Changelog:
## Version 1.0:
* added the compiler
* added variable support
* added converting to .sb3 file (compiling basically)

# Screenshots and showcases:
## say for seconds block on stage: (Apr 3)
(says undefined for a split second when run)
