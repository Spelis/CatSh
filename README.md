CatSh is a custom language that gets converted to a scratch .sb3 file.

# What you'll need:
  * `python`
  * wave python module

# Running:
  * open a shell
  * navigate to the folder where the python compilation script is located
  * run `python main.py convert {path to .catsh file}`
  * import the output.sb3 file into scratch and enjoy!
  * NOTE: there may be some duplicate blocks when importing. that is not done by the converter instead is done by scratch. if you know a fix, please [let me know](https://github.com/Spelis/CatSh/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

# Changelog:
